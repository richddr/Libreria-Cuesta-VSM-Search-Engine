Libreria-Cuesta-VSM-Search-Engine
=================================
Project from my Text Mining class:
Download a csv of all the books available on: http://www.libreriacuesta.com/ in order to create a information retrieval model based on a Vector Space Model. Using NLTK, preprocess all of the data from the csv file and create a python application that can receive a search query and return the relevant results. The efectiveness of this model is evaluated comparing the retrieved results list with a user defined list based on the search terms.

Technologies used: Python, NLTK.
